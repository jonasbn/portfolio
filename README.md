# Mathematician 
I am Ph.D mathematician specialized in functional analysis and operator theory with a focus on the dynamics of linear operators on Hilbert Spaces.  

Over the last few years I have shifted my focus to the study of data science and machine learning both in my teaching and scholarship.  

I also have considerable experience in mathematical content creation having worked as a consultant for different publishers over the years.
